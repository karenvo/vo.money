    "summary": "Cybersecurity practitioner with 5+ years of experience spanning security automation, cloud red teaming, and detection engineering. Known for building automation that delivers measurable results—94% reduction in alert noise, 85% faster response times—while designing analyst-facing interfaces that actually get used. Translates offensive techniques directly into defensive controls through dual-track red team and detection engineering work.",
    "achievements": [
      "Reduced phishing alert volume by 94% through automated severity classification using multi-source log correlation (Entra ID sign-in logs, Graph Activity logs) and threat intelligence enrichment—eliminating spam while preserving high-fidelity threats",
      "Improved incident response times by 85% by architecting SOAR playbooks with intuitive analyst interfaces, reducing cognitive load during triage",
      "Contributed custom integrations to the XSOAR Marketplace, extending platform capabilities for the broader community",
      "Executed cloud red team engagements identifying critical Azure/AWS security gaps, then authored corresponding detection rules to close identified attack paths"
